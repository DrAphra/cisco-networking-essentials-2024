**Wireless Router as DHCP Server**: The wireless router assigns IP addresses to devices (local hosts) on the internal network, usually using private IP addresses, which are not accessible from the internet.

**Internal Network**: The devices connected to the wireless router (wired or wireless) form the internal or inside network, with IP addresses in the same range as the router’s internal IP.

**External Network**: The side of the wireless router connected to the ISP is called the external or outside network, using an internet-routable public IP address.

**Default IPv4 Address**: The router’s internal IP address is typically the first address in the network (e.g., 192.168.1.1), and serves as the default gateway for the local devices.

**DHCP Client Role of Router**: The router also acts as a DHCP client to receive its external public IP address from the ISP.

**Boundary Between Networks**: The wireless router separates the internal private network from the external public internet, controlling access and routing traffic.

**Subnet Information**: The router provides connected devices with an IP address, subnet mask, and the router’s internal IP as the default gateway, allowing communication within the network and access to the internet.

This captures the core points related to how routers manage IP addresses and separate internal and external networks.
